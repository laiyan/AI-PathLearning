q-learning.cpp
-------------------------------------------------------
A program using q-learning to find the shortest path to
access the room 441 (home) at the CF building 4th floor

This program has used c++ language and developed by using
Visual Studio.

Stackoverflow problem may occur while using Visual Studio
to run, so need to change the stack reserve size to 4MB.

Also need to include the room.csv file in order to perform
the code right.

Assined value for the room can be found in room.csv and
visually in assignedFloorPlan.png
